Stitching Worlds (2014-2018) - Lead by Ebru Kurbak and Irene Posch, Stitching Worlds blends the territories of textiles and electronics by investigating textile technologies as controversial means for manufacturing electronic objects. The investigation was conducted with critical and artistic intentions through the creation of past-, present-, and future-tense narratives. What if electronics emerged from textile techniques, such as knitting, weaving, crochet, and embroidery? PENELOPE - Research project lead by Ellen Harlizius-Klück aiming to integrate ancient weaving into the history of science and technology, especially digital technology. The project encompasses the investigation of ancient sources as well as practices and technological principles of ancient weaving. Folding Electronic Textiles - Research project lead by Berit Greinke, investigating how novel soft circuits can be created through constructing electronic functionality as sculpted dynamic objects, rather than as plane surfaces. Intelligent Instruments - Research project lead by Thor Magnusson, studying the impact of creative AI, conducted in the research domain of music, with a broad humanities basis, involving musicians, computer scientists, philosophers and cognitive scientists in key international institutions. Through a streamlined research collaboration protocol, we seek to explore the language and discourse of creative AI, addressing our changed notions of, for example, agency, autonomy, authenticity, authorship, creativity and originality On-the-fly - a project promoting Live Coding practice, a performative technique focused on writing algorithms in real-time so that the one who writes is part of the algorithm. Lead by Hangar Barcelona in collaboration with ZKM, Ljudmila and Creative Coding Utrecht.
